## Project Title: Conversion App
## Project Description:
I have developed a unit conversion App using java that converts from one system to another. For example, you can easily convert binary numbers to decimal, octal, and hexadecimal numbers. I have made it very simple, and you can easily convert one to another among binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal. We can also convert ASCII to Char and vice versa. Moreover, it also allows the conversion of temperatures like Kelvin to Celsius and versa, Kelvin to Fahrenheit and vice versa, and Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa. In addition, you can also convert metric systems like a meter to kilometers and vice versa, etc. There are four portions or buttons in this App. The first button is named 'Number' which converts numbers system conversion as decimals to binary, etc. The other button is named 'ASCII/Char' which converts char to ASCII to Char and vice versa. The third portion contains Temperature conversions and the fourth portion contain metric system conversions.

### Software and Libraries Used: 
JavaFX.application.Application, JavaFX.fxml.FXMLLoader, JavaFX.scene.Parent, JavaFX.scene.Scene, JavaFX.stage.Stage, JavaFX.event.ActionEvent, JavaFX.fxml.FXML, JavaFX.scene.control.Button, JavaFX.scene.control.RadioButton, JavaFX.scene.control.TextArea, JavaFX.scene.control.TextField, JavaFX.scene.control.ToggleGroup, and we used FXML to decorate the app. SceneBuilder.
### Installation Instruction: 
Download the FXML library and save it on your PC in a separate file. Download 'Scene Builder' and install it. When you started to run the project in IntelliJ then go to 'file' then go to 'project structure' then 'Libraries' then add the FXML library by going to the portion where you have saved that library then the project will work. 
### Planned App's Features List: 
Converting decimal to binary and vice versa, decimal to octal and vice versa, decimal to hexadecimal and vice versa, Integers to ASCII and vice versa, conversion of to any given bases, temperatures conversion, metric system conversions, weight conversions, the degree to radian and vice versa and many other conversions.
### List of Completed Features: 
Converting decimal to binary and vice versa, decimal to octal and vice versa, decimal to hexadecimal and vice versa, Char to ASCII and vice versa, Conversions in the metric system, and conversions of temperatures. 
### List of Features Yet To be Implement: 
I am planning to make this App such that it should Convert numbers to any given base. I need to implement many other conversions like the degree to radian and vice versa etc. I also need to implement weight conversions if possible.
